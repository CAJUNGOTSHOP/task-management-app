## Creating Signed Commits

To create signed commits in Git, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a GPG key set up and configured for signing commits. You can generate a GPG key using the command:
   ```
   gpg --gen-key
   ```
   Follow the prompts to generate your GPG key.

2. Add your GPG key to your Git configuration using the command:
   ```
   git config --global user.signingkey <your-gpg-key-id>
   ```
   Replace `<your-gpg-key-id>` with your actual GPG key ID.

3. Use the `-S` option with the `git commit` command to create a signed commit. For example, to create a signed commit with the message "Initial commit", use the following command:
   ```
   git commit -S -m "Initial commit"
   ```

This will create a signed commit with the specified message.
