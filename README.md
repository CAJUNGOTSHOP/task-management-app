# Task Management Application

This is a web-based task management application where users can create, update, and delete tasks. The application includes user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify tasks. Additional features include task prioritization, due dates, and notifications to enhance the user experience.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Running Tests

To run tests, use the following command:
```
npm test
```

## Building for Production

To create a production build, use the following command:
```
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with the production-ready files.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, follow the instructions provided by your hosting provider. Ensure that you have set up the necessary environment variables for the application to function correctly.

## User Authentication and Authorization

The application includes user authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can access and modify tasks. Follow these steps to set up user authentication and authorization:

1. Register a new user:
   - Navigate to the registration page.
   - Fill in the required information (username and password).
   - Submit the registration form.

2. Log in with an existing user:
   - Navigate to the login page.
   - Enter your username and password.
   - Submit the login form.

3. Log out:
   - Click the logout button to log out of the application.

4. User permissions:
   - Only authenticated users can create, update, and delete tasks.
   - Ensure that you are logged in to access and modify tasks.

## Git Rebase with Signoff

The command `git rebase HEAD~3 --signoff` is used to rebase the last three commits and add a sign-off message to each commit. This is typically used to indicate that the author agrees to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).

* The `HEAD~3` part specifies the last three commits.
* The `--signoff` option adds a "Signed-off-by" line at the end of the commit message.

This command is useful when you need to rebase your commits and ensure that each commit has a sign-off message, which is often required for contributing to open source projects.

## Pushing Changes with Force-With-Lease

After rebasing your commits with a sign-off message, you need to push the changes to the remote repository. Use the following command to push the changes:

```
git push --force-with-lease origin add-aiplugintool
```

The `--force-with-lease` option ensures that you only force-push if your local branch is up-to-date with the remote branch, preventing accidental overwrites of other people's changes.
